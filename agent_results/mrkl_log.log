## Color Scheme
For population density, a sequential color scheme is most appropriate since the data represents a progression from low to high values:

# Interpreting US Population Density Patterns

When creating informative population density visualizations for the US:

## Key Considerations
- **Use appropriate scales**: Linear scales obscure nuance; logarithmic scales better represent the vast range (from <1 person/sq mi in Alaska to >70,000 in Manhattan)
- **Choose meaningful boundaries**: Census tracts or block groups reveal patterns obscured by county-level data
- **Consider choropleth alternatives**: Cartograms or dot density maps can reduce visual bias from large, sparsely populated areas

## Interpretation Guidance
- **Regional patterns**: Note the Boston-Washington corridor, Great Lakes cities, California coastal regions, and sparse Mountain West
- **Urban-rural divide**: Highlight that 83% of Americans live on just 3% of land area
- **Historical context**: Connect to settlement patterns, transportation networks, and geographic constraints

## Technical Best Practices
- Include clear legends with intuitive color schemes (sequential for density values)
- Normalize data appropriately when comparing regions
- Consider supplementing with ancillary data like transportation networks or terrain

Remember that visualization choices significantly impact viewer interpretation of population distribution patterns.
